/*
**BUG IN SECOND PHILOSOPHER
**Rare not understood, probably linked to semaphore lib, bug of directly
**quiting the program with a philospher dead at time_before_dead
**Caused by fault in calculation of
**"since_last_meal = current_time - p->last_meal_time;" while they all are
**equal to long long int -> show with commented printf that error makes no
**sense and only occurs in rare random cases
**Looks similar to not understood bug -> bug occurs whereas after a philospher
**dies, number of philospher becomes 0 and thread enters the eat_count write,
**for unknown reason
**Those bugs do not exist with use of mutex and
**are thus probably associated with semaphore lib
**NOT ANYMORE

/*
**Unsigned is not used for time calculation, because in very rare cases
**negative numbers were generated, that created random values in unsigned form
